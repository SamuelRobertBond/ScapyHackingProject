# ScapyHackingProject

This project uses Scapy for packetsniffing/modification and Libgdx and Kryonet for the game.

This was a project that I did for my software security class. It is seperated into two parts, a vunerable game, and script to hack that game. The game sends unencrypted network data which can be sniffed, modified, and sent back. The game lacks validation on some of data it receives to showcase what modifying packets can do in the right environment.
